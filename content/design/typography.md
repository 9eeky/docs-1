### UI typography

UI typography is defined in Spirit. Use the [`spirit-styles.js`](https://github.com/TryGhost/docs/blob/master/src/components/spirit-styles.js) helper to retrieve predefined class combinations for the most frequent typography settings (e.g. headings, paragraphs). Note that the helper class combinations reset the paddings and margins, i.e. vertical rhythm should be defined manually.

### Post content typography

Content typography is defined in [`post-content.css`](https://github.com/TryGhost/docs/blob/master/src/components/css/post-content.css). The definitions here include vertical rhythm.
