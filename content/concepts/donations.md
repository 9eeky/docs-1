As a non-profit organisation we're always grateful to receive any and all donations to help our work


## Partnerships

We're very [happy to partner](https://ghost.org/partners/) with startups and companies who are able to provide Ghost with credit, goods and services which help us build free, open software for everyone. Please reach out to us `hello@ghost.org` if you're interested in partnering with us to help Ghost.

## Open Collective

**New:** We have a number of ongoing donation and sponsorship opportunities for individuals or companies looking to make ongoing contributions to the open source software which they use on [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/ghost).
