There are a broad range of tools, resources and helpful tutorials for working with Ghost available to help  get started.

Before diving into Ghost's application architecture in the next section, it might be useful to give you a high level overview of the wider ecosystem and where to find things!


## Native Apps

Ghost ships with a web based admin interface, but there are also have a selection of native apps available which bring Ghost Admin to your devices.

### Ghost Desktop

Available for Mac, PC, and Linux. [Ghost Desktop](https://ghost.org/downloads/) allows you to access and edit your Ghost site without ever needing to log in again.

### Ghost Android

For Android users we have a native mobile application for writing and managing blog posts on the go. This is a community project and is a little experimental, but is comingalong nicely. You can find it over on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.ghost.android).

There's **no iOS app** at the moment, but it's something we're looking into!

## Community

Of course open source software is never just about the technology, more than anything it's about the people who make it and use it.

### Official Forum

The [official Ghost forum](https://forum.ghost.org) is the best place to find other Ghost users and developers, whether you're just looking for some advice or you need help with a tricky development problem. There's almost always someone around, as well as a wealth of past questions/answers in the searchable archives.

## Migration Tooling

If you're migrating to Ghost from an existing platform, there are a number of tools for translating your content into Ghost's JSON based import format.

The [migration docs](/api/migration/) contain details on all the available automated tools out there, as well as information about our import format in case you need to write your own migration script.

## Finding Themes

You'll find a wide range of pre-made Ghost themes for a variety of use-cases over on the [Ghost Marketplace](https://marketplace.ghost.org), which serves as an official directory of curated highlights. However, you can also find an even larger range of Ghost themes for sale on [ThemeForest](https://themeforest.net/category/blogging/ghost-themes) and [Creative Market](https://creativemarket.com/themes/ghost).

It's also pretty straightforward to convert themes for most other platforms to be compatible with Ghost, and you can always use a completely independent front-end or framework if that's your jam.
