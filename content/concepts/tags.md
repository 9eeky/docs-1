Tags are the primary taxonomy within Ghost for filtering and organising the relationships between your content

Right off the bat, probably the best way to think about tags in Ghost is like labels in GMail. Tags are a powerful, dynamic taxonomy which can be used to categorise content, control design, and drive automation within your site.

## Tag Types

### Normal Tag

### Primary Tag

### Internal Tag

## Sample API Data

Here's a sample tag object from the Ghost [Content API](/api/content/)

```JSON
tag: {
    "id": "1239bbfe90a518a862677abc",
    "name": "Getting Started",
    "slug": "getting-started",
    "parent": null,
    "feature_image": null,
    "visibility": "public",
    "meta_title": null,
    "meta_description": null,
    "created_at": "2014-11-17T19:02:27.147Z",
    "created_by": "1239bbfe90a518a862677abc",
    "updated_at": "2014-11-17T19:02:27.147Z",
    "updated_by": "1239bbfe90a518a862677abc"
  }
```
