A complete guide to install an instance of Ghost locally for development

## Overview

Welcome to the Ghost local install guide! If youâ€™re here to test Ghost locally or develop a theme, this is the guide for you. 

By the end of this tutorial you will have completed a local Ghost install that runs in development mode using sqlite3. 

If you would like to customise Ghost core, or contribute to the upstream repository, use the contribution guide.

> Local installs arenâ€™t suitable for production â€” head to [this install guide](https://docs.ghost.org/setup/ubuntu/) if you want to deploy to production.

## Prerequisites

We officially recommend following this local installation. However, `ghost install` is flexible, so if you want to skip parts of the process read through the install reference. 

To install Ghost locally use the following:


* Mac, Windows or Linux
* Node.js LTS versions (read more about versioning in troubleshooting)
* Ghost CLI
* A clean, empty directory on your machine

### Using nvm?

If youâ€™re using nvm on your local machine, ensure youâ€™re using the same environment when you install ghost-cli and when you run ghost commands. Read the troubleshooting guide for more information.

## Install Ghost CLI

The Ghost CLI is a fully loaded tool to help you get Ghost installed. With a local install, the CLI enables you to install a Ghost instance with a single command. 

`ghost-cli` is an npm module that can be installed with `npm` or `yarn` on a local machine. There is no requirement to use a non-root user for a local install. Installing on the root user removes the need to use `sudo`.

```
npm i -g ghost-cli@latest
```

`@latest` ensures the latest version of the  `ghost-cli` is installed. Using yarn, adjust this to:  
```
yarn global add ghost-cli@latest
```

Ghost CLI requires no configuration or setup. Once you've got it installed as a global module, you'll have the full suite of `ghost` commands ready at your disposal. Use `ghost help` for a list of commands.

## Install Ghost

Itâ€™s time to Install Ghost.

Following the prerequisites, have a clean empty directory ready for Ghost to be installed to on your machine. 

In your terminal, `cd` into the empty directory and run the install command:
```
ghost install local
```

This command wonâ€™t ask for further information but may take a few minutes. `ghost-cli` outputs information so that you can see what is running in the background. 

âœ¨ Once the install is finished you the CLI shows you where to visit your local site, where you can setup a new publication. This is usually on `http://localhost:2368` and `http://localhost:2368/ghost` to access Ghost admin.

### Install Information

Here are the key bits of info about `ghost install local`:


* Your publication is setup in `development` mode with less caching
* Logs only go to stdout
* The local install uses SQLite3 as the database, which helps with a seamless local install for theme development
* No additional setup steps run. Thereâ€™s no attempt to configure `nginx`, or `systemd` or SSL setup (this is for production installs only)


### Starting and stopping Ghost

Ghost runs in a separate process and remains running until you stop it or restart your machine. 

Useful commands: 

* Use `ghost stop` to stop Ghost
* Use `ghost start` to start Ghost (cd into the directory first)
* `ghost log` views logs
* Run `ghost ls` from anywhere â€“ lists all running Ghost blogs

### Debugging
For troubleshooting and errors, use the site search and [FAQ section](https://docs.ghost.org/faq/) to find information about common error messages.

## Developing Themes

When using Ghost CLI, your custom themes need to exist in the top-level directory: `/content/themes/`. They should not exist inside the `current` or `versions` folders.

Use the following steps for theme development, live reloading and theme validation. For more detailed guides on the building blocks of Handlebars.js Ghost themes, read the concepts guide. 


###Â Live reloading

Theme development requires the ability to restart Ghost to pick up changes that wonâ€™t be applied automatically. This is accomplished using nodemon.


### Install nodemon

Ensure Ghost is stopped inside your local directory run:
```
ghost stop
```

Install nodemon globally:

```
npm install -g nodemon@latest
```

Before starting Ghost with nodemon, consider the following: 


* Ensure your theme folder is ready in `content/themes`. 
* If youâ€™re running the Casper (Ghostâ€™s default theme), some additional tools to process the CSS and transform it to be fully browser compatible. Use the Casper readme to get started.
* If you base your theme on Casper, update the name in package.json.
* To use an empty folder for your theme, you'll need to create a `post.hbs`,  `index.hbs` and a valid `package.json` in that folder before starting Ghost. These are the minimum requirements for a valid theme.

Start Ghost with nodemon using:
```
nodemon current/index.js --watch content/themes/[your-theme-name] --ext hbs,js,css
```

This starts Ghost, watching all hbs, js and css files inside of the [your-theme-name] folder. When you add new templates or make changes, Ghost restarts.


### Validating with GScan

GScan is a tool that validates Ghost themes for the latest versions of Ghost. 

Ghost automatically runs this tool when a theme is uploaded or activated. For development purposes, run these checks yourself by globally installing the `gscan` npm package:
```
npm install -g gscan
```

Once this is installed you can run `gscan <file path>` anywhere to run the checks against a folder on your computer, for example: 
```
gscan /path/to/ghost/content/themes/casper
```

To run GScan on a zip file, pass the `-z` flag
```
gscan -z /path/to/downloads/theme.zip
```

GScan can also be accessed at [gscan.ghost.org](https://gscan.ghost.org/), where you can sign up for the latest updates as a Ghost theme developer. 

## What's next ðŸ‘‰

To summarise, in this section you installed the Ghost CLI and installed Ghost locally â€” congrats! You can now put Ghost through itâ€™s paces and see what itâ€™s all about, or jump right into developing a custom Ghost theme. 

Remember, local installs are not suitable for production. If you decide to deploy to production, [follow this guide](https://docs.ghost.org/install/ubuntu/).
